							<h3>Layoff</h3>
							<p>Today, research has suggested that tech giants and internet companies are one of the most popular types of employers in China's employment blueprint. Every year, countless employers compete to land a job in Chinese Dachang. According to a report from Maimai, in the past few years, these large companies have received much recognition due to their high wages and generous benefits.</p>
							<p>However, since 2021, China's internet technology giants have been reported to be implementing large-scale layoffs, causing a huge stir on social media. Data from the job search platform Maimai shows that in December 2021, the number of new hires in e-commerce, social media, top ride-hailing, and gaming companies dropped sharply. In the following year, companies such as Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili and ByteDance, the Chinese owner of the short video platform Tiktok, continued to lay off employees and slowed down their recruitment of new staff.</p>
							<p><a href="https://m.21jingji.com/article/20221130/herald/a71343d622597d9907369e6e90332d6e_ths.html">On the Bilibili Q3 earnings call on November 29, 2022, Bilibili's Chairman and CEO, Chen Rui, said that Bilibili would optimize its organizational structure, and reduced losses had become one of the company's most important tasks.</a> However, not long after, on December 6, Bilibili announced layoffs, which quickly go virus on Weibo. The layoffs affected departments such as comics and live broadcasting, with compensation being offered to employees who were let go based on their years of service plus two months' salary. Bilibili's official responsed that the layoffs were part of a business adjustment and personnel changes, but not a large-scale layoff.</p>
							<p>In April 2022, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4MjUxODMwMg==&mid=2649633926&idx=1&sn=68bec3f7c91c96716b323a5b19920a77&chksm=879e1cf7b0e995e1caca97e62689dd3508f78321b8102aa137d87c613b8b329a4e0f7938f22b#rd">well-known leaker "GuangZiXingQiu" reported that Chinese food delivery giant Meituan had initiated its personnel optimization, resulting in a cut of over 15% of the company's overall staff.</a> RED, one of China's newest and fastest-growing social media platforms, also had been exposed layoffs of 20% of its workforce, affecting all departments in Beijing, Shanghai, and other locations. Later, RED quietly clarified through its WeChat public account that it was just "normal staff turnover."</p>
							<p><a href="https://www.jiemian.com/article/8594074.html">According to an article from Jiemian Network Technology, on December 2022, Xiaomi, one of the biggest smartphone manufacturers in the world, had begun laying off thousands of workers in China, including in its smartphone and internet businesses. </a> In the first nine months of 2022, Xiaomi laid off nearly 1,900 people. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E7%BD%91%E4%BF%A1%E5%8A%9E%E5%9B%9E%E5%BA%94%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E2%80%9C%E8%A3%81%E5%91%98%E6%BD%AE%E2%80%9D%EF%BC%8C%E7%A7%B0%E8%BF%91%E5%8D%8A%E5%B9%B4%E6%9D%A5%E7%94%A8%E5%B7%A5%E4%BA%BA%E6%95%B0%E4%BF%9D%E6%8C%81%E5%B9%B3%E7%A8%B3-idCNL3S2W60O7">Statistics from the Cyberspace Administration of China</a> showed from July 2021 to March 2022, a total of over 21000 employees from 12 internet companies including Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, ByteDance got laid off.</p>
							<p>The trend of layoffs among Chinese tech giants has continued into this year. In early 2023, <a href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1753629728223585091&wfr=spider&for=pc">Chinese tech giant ByteDance</a> initiated a round of layoffs that impacted thousands of employees. The enterprise collaboration tool Lark was among the hardest hit departments, with about a tenth of its workforce affected. In February, Chinese tech giant <a href="https://investorplace.com/2023/02/tencent-layoffs-2023-is-tcehy-gearing-up-for-more-job-cuts/">Tencent</a> announced a restructuring of its XR business, resulting in the layoff of approximately 300 employees. In March, Chinese e-commerce giant <a href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1728049725442477062&wfr=spider&for=pc">Jingdong</a> disclosed plans to reduce its workforce on its social commerce platform by 10-15 percent. Despite these major layoffs, tech giants used terms such as "normal optimization," "end-of-cycle elimination," and "trimming the fat" to sugarcoat the situation and avoid scrutiny from labor authorities. Alibaba claimed that its layoffs were meant to "release talent into society," while Jingdong was the first to use the term "graduation" to describe its terminated employees.</p>








							<h3>35 years old curse</h3>
							
							
							<p>35 is the end of the youth stage and the beginning of middle age. China's official <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2017-04/13/content_5185555.htm#1">"Medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Youth (2016-2025)"</a>  defines the age range of youth as 14 to 35. </p>
							<p>The curse of 35 refers to companies explicitly or implicitly choosing candidates under the age of 35 when recruiting. When a person reaches the age of 35, their career advancement opportunities at their current workplace begin to narrow, and it becomes increasingly challenging to find suitable jobs when re-entering the job market.							</p>

Top of the inverted U-shaped curve is regarded as the "golden age." <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5187816_Is_Well-being_U-Shaped_over_the_Life_Cycle">Another research</a>, conducted by professors from Dartmouth College in the United States and the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, shows that individuals in 55 nations reach a low point in their mental well-being around the age of 46, whereas China reaches a low point at the age of 36. </p>

									<br />
									<p>Before 2000, the "golden age" in the United States and China remained stable at around 50 to 55 years old. After 2000, the golden age in the United States remained unchanged, but China's golden age continued to decline, falling to 35 years old after 2005."</p>

									<p><a href="https://abfer.org/media/abfer-events-2021/annual-conference/papers-tgd/AC21P4020_Golden-Ages-A-Tale-of-Two-Labor-Markets.pdf">A study from the University of Pennsylvania</a> divides the reasons for changes in wages with age into three categories: work experience, time effects (changes in average wage levels for different years), and cohort effects (differences in worker abilities for each generation). They found that the time and cohort effects for different generations in the United States are small, but in China, they have a huge impact. For Chinese workers, due to changes in industry structure and the rapid evolution of workers' education levels, the changes in wages brought about by time and cohort effects are far higher than the value of personal work experience growth. As shown in the graph, in China, wages begin to decline with age starting at around 35 years old. In other words, 35-year-old employees are the most valuable. Physiologically speaking, 35 is not the beginning of a comprehensive decline in physical and psychological quality. In fact, the midlife crisis often occurs gradually between the ages of 40 and 50 globally.</p>

							<p>However, in internet companies, elimination and renewal are the norm, and the age crisis will not wait until the age of 35 to arrive. In early 2021, Maimai released the<a href="https://maimai.cn/article/detail?fid=1444624016&efid=Mm_7Fqt80I-BhSKjeotWFg">"Internet Talent Mobility Report 2020"</a>, which showed that the average age of employees in 19 top internet companies nationwide was 29.6 years old, with ByteDance and Pinduoduo having an average age of only 27 years old. In 2020, when NetEase was listed in Hong Kong for the second time, CEO and director Ding Lei released a shareholder letter stating that "NetEase in the future will establish a self-evolving organization that will always stay at the age of 29." The letter also revealed that during the 20 years of expansion from 221 employees to over 20,000 employees, the average age of NetEase employees has always been kept below 29 years old.

							<h3>a stepping stone, not a final destination</h3>
							<p>As the various positions and functions of China's internet tech giants continue to become more specialized, employee autonomy and creativity are being replaced by institutionalized management and division of labor. "Although I'm in a rapidly developing industry, the business cross-section that many employees can come into contact with is actually very small. Many times, I don't know how much impact my work has on the overall business. I feel like a small screw inside a big machine," said Dong Lue, a formal intern at NetEase and Bytedance. Due to the inability of small companies to bear many employees, employees often have multiple job skills, which has led many employees of tech giants to face career crises around the age of 35 and find it difficult to find their next destination outside of tech giants. </p>
							<p>"Due to the lack of personnel, small companies need more versatile talents, while in tech giants, employees can often excel in several skills, but lack experience in other skills," Sharon Lu said," For most employees, tech giants can only serve as a stepping stone, rather than a final destination."</p>
